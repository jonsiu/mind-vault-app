## Desktop app process management

- **Main Process**: Single main process manages application lifecycle, windows, and system integration
- **Renderer Processes**: One renderer process per window (Electron); isolated for security
- **Process Isolation**: Enable context isolation and sandbox for renderer processes
- **IPC Communication**: Use IPC for main-renderer communication; contextBridge for secure exposure
- **Window Management**: Create/close windows from main process; track window state
- **Multi-Window State**: Synchronize state across multiple windows; use IPC or shared state store
- **Window Lifecycle**: Handle window events (close, minimize, maximize, focus, blur)
- **Prevent Accidental Close**: Confirm before closing window with unsaved changes
- **Background Windows**: Keep windows alive in background or close to free memory
- **Window Restoration**: Save and restore window position, size, and state
- **Display Management**: Handle multi-monitor setups; restore windows to correct display
- **Process Crashes**: Handle renderer process crashes gracefully; reload or show error
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage; close unused windows to free memory
- **Process Priority**: Set process priority appropriately; lower for background tasks
- **Child Processes**: Spawn child processes for heavy tasks; use Node child_process
- **Process Communication**: Communicate with child processes via stdio or IPC
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean up resources on app quit; save state before exit
- **Force Quit Handling**: Handle force quit (SIGTERM); limited cleanup time
- **Single Instance**: Optionally enforce single instance; bring existing instance to focus
- **Deep Links**: Register protocol handler; open app from URLs
