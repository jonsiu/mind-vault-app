## Production excellence and operational maturity

- **Incident Management**: Define incident severity levels (P0-P4); establish on-call rotation; use incident management tool
- **Incident Response**: Follow incident response process: detect → triage → mitigate → resolve → postmortem
- **Communication During Incidents**: Establish communication channels (Slack, status page); provide regular updates to stakeholders
- **Status Page**: Maintain public status page for customer-facing services (Statuspage.io, Atlassian Statuspage)
- **On-Call Rotation**: Rotate on-call responsibilities; compensate for on-call time; limit consecutive on-call weeks
- **Runbooks**: Create runbooks for common issues and procedures; link alerts to relevant runbooks
- **Playbooks**: Develop playbooks for incident types (database outage, DDoS attack, data breach)
- **Escalation Path**: Define clear escalation path; know who to call for critical issues
- **Blameless Culture**: Foster blameless culture; focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- **Postmortems**: Conduct postmortems after incidents; identify root cause, contributing factors, and action items
- **Postmortem Template**: Use consistent postmortem template (timeline, impact, root cause, action items)
- **Postmortem Distribution**: Share postmortems across organization; learn from others' incidents
- **Action Item Tracking**: Track action items from postmortems to completion; measure time to implement
- **Chaos Engineering**: Practice chaos engineering to validate system resilience; use Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, or LitmusChaos
- **Game Days**: Conduct game days to practice incident response; simulate outages and test runbooks
- **Disaster Recovery**: Document disaster recovery plan; define RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective)
- **Backup and Restore**: Regularly test backup and restore procedures; automate backups; store backups in different region
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource utilization; forecast capacity needs; provision ahead of demand
- **Performance Budgets**: Set performance budgets for page load time, API latency, database queries
- **Deployment Strategy**: Use blue-green, canary, or rolling deployments; automate rollback on errors
- **Deployment Frequency**: Measure deployment frequency; frequent small deployments reduce risk
- **Lead Time**: Measure lead time from commit to production; aim for hours not weeks
- **Change Failure Rate**: Track percentage of deployments that cause incidents; aim for < 15%
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Measure MTTR; aim to reduce over time through automation and better observability
- **Operational Reviews**: Conduct regular operational reviews; discuss incidents, trends, and improvements
