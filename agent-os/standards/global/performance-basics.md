## Performance best practices

- **Profile Before Optimizing**: Always profile to identify actual bottlenecks before optimizing; don't guess
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Focus on correct, maintainable code first; optimize only proven bottlenecks
- **Performance Budgets**: Define performance budgets (response times, load times, resource usage) and monitor them
- **Measure and Monitor**: Continuously measure key performance metrics in production; track trends over time
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching at appropriate layers (in-memory, CDN, database, HTTP) to reduce redundant work
- **Cache Invalidation**: Have a clear cache invalidation strategy; stale caches cause bugs
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed rather than all upfront (images, modules, data)
- **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets; never return unbounded result sets
- **Database Indexing**: Index frequently queried columns; but balance with write performance impact
- **N+1 Query Problem**: Avoid N+1 queries; use joins, eager loading, or batching to minimize database round trips
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for databases and external services to reduce connection overhead
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await or non-blocking I/O for I/O-bound operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute independent operations in parallel when possible
- **Batch Processing**: Batch related operations together to reduce overhead (database inserts, API calls)
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always clean up resources (close connections, release memory, cancel subscriptions)
- **Memory Management**: Be aware of memory usage; avoid memory leaks by properly disposing of objects and listeners
- **Data Structure Selection**: Choose appropriate data structures for your use case (arrays, hash maps, trees, sets)
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Understand time and space complexity of algorithms; prefer O(log n) or O(n) over O(nÂ²)
- **Minimize Network Calls**: Reduce network round trips; batch requests, use WebSockets for real-time, compress payloads
- **Compression**: Use gzip/brotli compression for text-based resources (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, APIs)
- **Content Delivery Network**: Use CDNs for static assets to reduce latency and server load
- **Debouncing and Throttling**: Use debouncing/throttling for frequently triggered events (scrolling, resizing, typing)
- **Code Splitting**: Split code into smaller chunks; load only what's needed for current page/feature
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code through tree shaking in build process
- **Avoid Blocking Operations**: Never block the main thread/event loop with CPU-intensive or synchronous I/O operations
- **Optimize Critical Path**: Identify and optimize the critical rendering/execution path
- **Regular Performance Reviews**: Include performance review in code reviews; prevent performance regressions
- **Load Testing**: Perform load testing to understand system capacity and breaking points before going to production
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
