## Documentation best practices

- **README.md Required**: Every project must have a README.md with overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines
- **README Structure**: Include sections: Project name/description, Prerequisites, Installation, Usage, Configuration, Contributing, License, Contact
- **Quick Start**: Provide a quick start section that gets users from zero to working example in minutes
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Maintain a CHANGELOG.md following keepachangelog.com format to track notable changes between versions
- **Changelog Format**: Organize by version and date; categorize changes as Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- **List Breaking Changes**: Always explicitly call out breaking changes, deprecations, and removals in changelog and release notes
- **Docs as Code**: Store documentation alongside code in version control; review docs in pull requests like code
- **Keep Docs Updated**: Update documentation whenever code changes; stale docs are worse than no docs
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document important architecture decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **API Documentation**: Document all public APIs using standard formats (JSDoc, docstrings, Swagger/OpenAPI, API Blueprint)
- **Code Comments**: Explain WHY code does something, not WHAT it does; the code itself should be self-documenting for WHAT
- **Examples First**: Start documentation with practical examples before diving into detailed explanations
- **Troubleshooting Section**: Include common issues and their solutions; save time for both users and maintainers
- **Environment Setup**: Document all environment variables, configuration options, and their default values
- **Development Guide**: Provide setup instructions for development environment; include how to run tests, linter, formatter
- **Contributing Guide**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for pull requests, code style, testing requirements, review process
- **Inline Documentation**: Use inline documentation for complex algorithms or non-obvious code sections
- **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams, screenshots, or architecture diagrams where they add clarity (mermaid, PlantUML)
- **Version Compatibility**: Document which versions of dependencies, platforms, or runtimes are supported
- **Migration Guides**: Provide migration guides when making breaking changes between major versions
- **Link to Resources**: Link to relevant external resources, RFCs, or documentation for deeper understanding
- **Search and Discovery**: Organize documentation so information is easy to find; use clear headings and table of contents
- **Onboarding Documentation**: Create onboarding docs for new team members; include architecture overview and development workflow
- **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is accessible (proper headings, alt text for images, clear language)
- **Avoid Duplication**: Keep documentation in one authoritative place; link to it rather than duplicating across locations
